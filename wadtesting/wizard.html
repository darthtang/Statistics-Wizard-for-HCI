                        A normal distribution is an arrangement of a data set in which most values cluster in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically toward either extreme. Height is one simple example of something that follows a normal distribution pattern: Most people are of average height, 
                        the numbers of people that are taller and shorter than average are fairly equal and a very small (and still roughly equivalent) number of people are either 
                        extremely tall or extremely short. Hereâ€™s an example of a normal distribution curve
